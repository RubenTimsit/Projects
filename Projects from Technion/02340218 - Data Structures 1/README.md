Due to increasing competition in the world of streaming services, the streaming service Webflix wants to improve its service. For this purpose, the service asked for your help in building a data structure that will allow it to manage its movie database and users in a better and more efficient way.
Each user or movie in the system is represented by a unique numerical identifier. The system allows the entry and exit of users and movies, and also allows tracking of various statistics related to users and movies. In addition, the system will allow users to watch movies alone or in viewing groups and will be able to provide viewing recommendations.

**Subject :** Data structures like Binary Trees, AVL, B-Trees, Rank Trees, time and space complexity.

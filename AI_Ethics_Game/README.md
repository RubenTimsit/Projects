# 🤖 Moral Choices Simulator - Can You Code Ethics?

Welcome! 👋  
This mini-game was created as part of my reflection on one of the most complex and fascinating challenges in Artificial Intelligence: **the ethics of coding moral choices**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

As a Computer Science student with a passion for AI, I've always been intrigued by the question:  
**Can we truly program human morality and conscience?**

This project aims to demonstrate how difficult it is to embed moral reasoning into algorithms - especially when human lives are at stake. Inspired by ethical dilemmas in autonomous vehicles, the simulator puts *you* in the position of the programmer.

## 🚗 The Scenario

Imagine you are designing the decision-making algorithm of a self-driving car.  
An unavoidable accident is about to occur. You must **choose who the car will save**.

- Do you protect the person on the sidewalk or the one on the pedestrian crossing?
- Do you save a child or an adult?
- A pregnant woman or a group of young people?
- What if family ties are involved?

Each decision forces you to assign a "priority score" to lives - an ethically perilous task.

## 🎮 The Game

In this interactive mini-game, you are presented with a series of moral dilemmas. Your mission:  
➡️ Make a decision in each scenario  
➡️ Reflect on the reasoning behind your choices  
➡️ Compare your decisions with those generated by OpenAI's most advanced model

⚠️ **There are no right or wrong answers.**  
This is not about judgment - it's about thinking, discussing, and realizing how difficult these decisions truly are.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

As AI systems become more autonomous, they will inevitably encounter moral choices.  
But how do we teach a machine to weigh one life over another?  
This game is a small step toward understanding the broader question of **ethics in AI**.
